# LIRI-Bot-

This app is created with a Node Command Line model. 

The user can run the app, and enter a command followed by their desired search. 

LIRI-BOT will perform the task and return information based on the input. There are 3-4 options for available commands. LIRI can use the API's for Spotify, BandsInTown, and OMDB.

I formatted LIRI's responses to appear in the terminal window, and to be readable and practical. The idea is to display the vital info about the search topic in a clean and organized fashion, making the app memorable and re-usable with ease.
